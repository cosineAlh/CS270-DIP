To run the experiments, run main.py in folder ./code.
	If you want to run English recognition with underline, copy templates from folder ./data/typed_with_underline into folder ./data/typed
	If you want to run English recognition without underline, copy templates from folder ./data/typed_no_underline into folder ./data/typed
	If you find the algorithm too slow, see readme.txt in folder ./code.
	You can also throw templates into folder ./data/typed to see its performance.

Further information of the code, see readme.txt in folder ./code.
